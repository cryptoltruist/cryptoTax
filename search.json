New Features: New pkgdown website two vignettes: one calculating ACB tax treatments decisions. Informative progress bars format_ACB format_suploss since functions extremely slow thousands transactions. Added example data sets (ACB, cryptotaxcalculator, coinpanda, koinly, shakepay, CDC) New function: format_generic, process transaction history files supported existing functions. New function: format_binance, general version works general transaction report includes rewards (withdrawal fees). thus get rid format_binance_trades since former superior (includes transaction types). Improvements: Consistently use plural reward types. Massive improvements speed using joins price lookups (instead making new API request row) prices coins USD CAD conversions. New tests format_shakepay, format_CDC, format_generic, ACB. ACB_suploss: integrates primary ACB function, accordingly gains new logical argument, suploss. format_suploss: integrates ACB suploss = TRUE, gains greatly improved code base. add_quantities: switches -loop dplyr code. providing first buy transactions (ACB…) one currency provided time insufficient columns provided calculate ‘total.price’ report_revenues crypto_pie: Now support forks mining. format_newton: updated new format new, unregistered transaction types detected withdrawal fees detected automatically. new transaction types supported: forks (“admin_wallet_credited”), sales (“crypto_viban_exchange”, “card_top_up”, “crypto_wallet_swap_debited”), supercharger rewards (“supercharger_reward_to_app_credited”) coinmarketcap, 2022-05-28, LUNA gets renamed LUNC, LUNA2 fork gets renamed LUNA. confusing CDC, use terms LUNA LUNC (), LUNA2, new LUNA fork. Therefore, now rename “LUNA” transactions (CDC) “LUNC”, “LUNA2” “LUNA”. Bug Fixes: format_shakepay: now correctly detect CAD referral rewards format_binance: now correctly detect interest rewards fixed bug whereas superficial loss quantity = 0 prevent computation ACB. corrected “Total time elapsed:” time unit always minutes ACB: now correctly accept alternative column names Fixed bug NANO/XNO Fixed various R CMD check errors, warnings, notes.","code":""},{"path":"https://cryptoltruist.github.io/cryptoTax/news/index.html","id":"cryptotax-001","dir":"Changelog","previous_headings":"","what":"cryptoTax 0.0.1","title":"cryptoTax 0.0.1","text":"New package","code":""}]
