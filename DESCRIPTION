Description: Helps calculate crypto taxes in R. First by allowing 
  you to format .CSV files from various exchanges to one
  large dataframe of organized transactions. Second, by allowing you to 
  calculate your Adjusted Cost Base (ACB), ACB per share, and 
  realized and unrealized capital gains/losses. Third by calculating
  revenues gained from staking, interest, airdrops, etc. Fourth, by 
  calculating superficial losses as well. Only supports basic or simple 
  tax scenarios (for now). *Disclaimer: This is not financial advice. 
  Use at your own risks. There are no guarantees whatsoever in relation 
  to the use of this package. Please consult a tax professional as necessary*.
