# cryptoTax: Crypto taxes in R (Canada only) <img src='man/figures/logo.png' align="right" height="140" style="float:right; height:200px;" />

Helps calculate crypto taxes in R.

1. First, by allowing you to format .CSV files from various exchanges to one large dataframe of organized transactions.
2. Second, by allowing you to calculate your Adjusted Cost Base (ACB), ACB per share, and realized and unrealized capital gains/losses.
3. Third, by calculating revenues gained from staking, interest, airdrops, etc.
4. Fourth, by calculating superficial losses as well, if desired.

Only supports basic or simple tax scenarios (for now).
