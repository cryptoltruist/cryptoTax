Helps calculate crypto taxes in R.

1. First, by allowing you to format .CSV files from various exchanges to one large dataframe of organized transactions.
2. Second, by allowing you to calculate your Adjusted Cost Base (ACB), ACB per share, and realized and unrealized capital gains/losses.
3. Third, by calculating revenues gained from staking, interest, airdrops, etc.
4. Fourth, by calculating superficial losses as well, if desired.

Only supports basic or simple tax scenarios (for now).

# Installation

To install, use:

``` r
remotes::install_github("cryptoltruist/cryptoTax")
```

# ACB demo

```{r}
library(cryptoTax)
data <- adjustedcostbase.ca_1
data
ACB(data, spot.rate = "price", sup.loss = FALSE)
```

For more on calculating the ACB, as well as superficial losses, see the [corresponding vignette](cryptoTaxarticles/ACB.html).

# Supported exchanges

Currently, the following exchanges are supported with the `format_*` functions:

1. Adalite
1. Binance
1. BlockFi
1. Crypto.com (app, exchange, wallet)
1. Celsius
1. CoinSmart
1. Exodus wallet
1. Gemini
1. Newton
1. Pooltool (ADA)
1. Presearch
1. Shakepay

To support another exchange not listed here, please open an issue. You can also prepare your own file according to the style of one of those exchanges and use the corresponding function.

# Workflow demo

```{r workflow, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Prepare list of coins
my.coins <- c("BTC", "CRO", "ETH", "ETHW")
list.prices <- prepare_list_prices(coins = my.coins, start.date = "2021-01-01")
# Note that for some exchanges this step may be unnecessary

# Load data and format shakepay file
data(shakepay)
formatted.shakepay <- format_shakepay(shakepay)

# Load data and format CDC file
data(CDC)
formatted.CDC <- format_CDC(CDC)

# Merge data from the different exchanges
all.data <- merge_exchanges(formatted.shakepay, formatted.CDC)

# Format data with ACB
formatted.ACB <- format_ACB(all.data)

# Let's get a preview of the output
as.data.frame(formatted.ACB[c(1, 4, 8, 10, 19, 20), c(1:6, 7:14, 24:26)])
```

### Summary info

```{r summary, warning=FALSE}
# Get latest ACB.share for each coin (ACB)
report_overview(formatted.ACB,
  today.data = TRUE, tax.year = "2021",
  local.timezone = "America/Toronto"
)

# Get summary of realized capital gains and losses
report_summary(formatted.ACB,
  today.data = TRUE, tax.year = "2021",
  local.timezone = "America/Toronto"
)
```

### Revenue estimation

```{r revenues, warning=FALSE}
table.revenues <- report_revenues(formatted.ACB, tax.year = "2021")
table.revenues

# Plot revenues by exchange
crypto_pie(table.revenues)

# Plot revenues by reward type
crypto_pie(table.revenues, by = "revenue.type")
```
