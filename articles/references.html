<p>If you have capital losses that exceed capital gains in the current
year, you can (but don’t have to) carry back the losses to any of the 3
preceding taxation years to be deducted against capital gains in those
years. Capital losses can also be carried forward indefinitely.</p>
<p>How about when shares are bought, and then fully sold immediately
after? Can a capital loss be claimed in this case? As long as all the
shares are sold, and you don’t repurchase the shares within the 30-day
period following the sale’s settlement date, you can claim a capital
loss. Remember that two conditions must apply for the superficial loss
rule: shares must be bought within the 61-day period, AND, some shares
must still be owned at the end of the period. In the case where all
shares are sold (and nothing’s repurchased) the superficial loss rule
does not apply as long as you don’t own any shares at the end of the
61-day period.</p>

<p><strong>Avoid Headaches by Deferring the Entire Capital Loss for
Simplicity</strong></p>
<p>The conditions for partially applying the superficial loss rule for
partial dispositions provide an advantage to Canadian investors. Instead
of using a strict interpretation of the superficial loss rule in these
kinds of cases that denies losses in full, the CRA allows investors to
partially claim the loss.</p>
<p>But you’re not obligated to partially claim the loss; you can opt for
the entire loss to be denied (and carried forward in most cases). If the
loss is relatively small it may not be worth the headache of performing
these calculations to determine the partially allowable loss. And
remember that when the superficially loss rule denies a capital loss,
the amount of the capital loss can usually be added to the ACB of the
reacquired shares, so that the loss is effectively carried forward as
opposed to being permanently denied.</p>

<p>Since the superficial loss rule denies capital losses under certain
circumstances, you might ask, can capital gains be avoided in certain
cases? For example, if you sell shares and realize a capital gain, but
immediately repurchase the shares, can you call this a “superficial
gain” and defer the capital gain? The answer is no: you cannot defer the
capital gain and there is no such thing as a “superficial gain.” The
capital gain is taxable immediately in the current tax year, even if the
shares are repurchased within 30 days.</p>

<p>Most exchanges will charge you a transfer fee to move your crypto. If
you pay this transfer fee in CAD or another fiat currency - this is tax
free. But most of the time, you’ll pay these transfer fees in crypto.
Spending crypto is a disposition, so it’s a taxable event and subject to
Capital Gains Tax. This means if the price of your asset has increased
since you bought it, when you then spend crypto to transfer it - you’ll
have a capital gain. The CRA doesn’t have guidance on whether transfer
fees are an allowable cost - so we don’t know if you can add them to
your cost basis under the adjusted cost basis rules. But it’s unlikely
that transfer fees are tax deductible. Therefore the fees are taken into
account for gain calculation. A value increase is a a taxable benefit
(e.g. you if you need less amount of a coin to pay the fee).</p>
<p>(<a href="https://koinly.io/guides/crypto-tax-canada" class="external-link uri">https://koinly.io/guides/crypto-tax-canada</a>)</p>
<p>Sometimes when you transfer assets between wallets, you’ll pay a gas
fee. However, the Capital Gains Tax guidance in most countries is quite
clear that you can only add fees associated with acquiring or disposing
of an asset to your cost basis. You’re not doing this when you make a
transfer. There isn’t any clear guidance on this yet from any tax
office. So you can choose to take a conservative or a more aggressive
approach to your crypto taxes.</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>conservative</strong> approach would be to treat this as a
taxable event. You’re spending ETH - like on a good or a service - so
it’s subject to Capital Gains Tax.</li>
<li>A more <strong>measured</strong> approach is to claim it as spent,
but not recognize any capital gain or loss from the transaction.</li>
<li>Finally, an <strong>aggressive</strong> approach would be to add it
to your cost basis.</li>
</ul>
<p>We recommend a conservative approach to transfer fees as other
approaches may not stand up to scrutiny by tax authorities.</p>

<p>There are multiple ways to approach tax treatment of these fees,

the conservative approach.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Conservative</strong>: Treat ETH fees spent in this instance
as taxable sales, as if you had spent ETH on a good or service.</li>
<li>
<strong>Medium</strong>: Claim the Ethereum spent on fees as removed
from your holdings, but don’t recognize a capital gain or loss.</li>
<li>
<strong>Aggressive</strong>: Claim ETH as a sale for 0 USD, claiming
a capital loss on ETH spent. You could also potentially add ETH transfer
fees to your cost basis. However, the IRS could argue that these
transfers were not necessary for the subsequent ETH sale to take place,
thus this is a more contentious tax standpoint.</li>

<p>The majority of Canadian consumers don’t have to pay taxes on their
credit card rewards. As long as you’re earning points, miles, or cash
back for personal purchases (i.e., not for business purchases), the CRA
will look at them as discounts and coupons, not income. Much like you
don’t report savings from grocery coupons, you won’t report your credit
card rewards on your tax filing.</p>

<p>Is it business income or capital gain? The income tax treatment for

activities are a personal activity (a hobby) or a business activity. […]
If a hobby is pursued in a <em>sufficiently commercial and businesslike

<p>For airdrops and hard forks, unlike the US where guidance is unclear,
in Canada the cost basis is zero for these coins. Therefore when the
coins are disposed the entire proceeds are considered capital gains (for

<p>In most cases, a business activity needs to involve repetitive
actions over time. … If your mining is just a personal hobby, you will
only pay capital gains tax when you later sell (dispose of) the received
coins. Because you didn’t pay anything for the coins originally, the
cost basis should be considered as zero so that your capital gains are
equal to the market value (in CAD) at the time when you sell the coins
in the future. … The Canadian Revenue Agency has not released specific
guidance for staking of cryptocurrency. Because staking is similar in
nature to mining of cryptocurrencies, the safest approach is to treat
received coins from staking in a similar fashion to mining. …</p>
<p>The CRA has not issued specific guidance to the tax treatment of
cryptocurrency airdrops, but a safe approach is to pay capital gains tax
when you later decide to sell the coins. Similar to crypto received from
mining, you should assume a cost basis equal to zero because you did not
pay anything to acquire the coins.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> How to treat Shakepay sats?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> In that case, it would be a cost basis of 0.
Shaking your phone does not constitute earning income. So say you sell
it all for $10, that $10 is added to your income at $5 (cap gains 50%)
and then taxed. It would be a sale for $10 with a cost basis of 0.</p>

<p>I would love to be able to shed some further light on this topic,
however, there are a few factors at play that make it difficult to do
so. Currently, these areas have not received any specific CRA guidance
so I refrain from providing any general guidance on these matters. The
reasoning for this is that there can be risks involved depending on how
aggressive or conservative you are with reporting the crypto received.
Treating it as income when received is usually the conservative bet;
adding it with a cost base of $0 can be more aggressive.</p>
<p>There will be a ton of different/varying information out there on
this from individuals and accountants. […] In general, if you want to
remain very conservative (which may not always be the best approach),
then treating things as income when received will achieve this. For
staking rewards - we generally always recommend treating it as income
when received.</p>

<p>The flexible approach to tracing/linking borrowed money to eligible
uses cannot be applied to the repayment of borrowed money where a single
borrowing account (such as a <strong>line of credit</strong>, mortgage
or loan) is used for eligible and ineligible purposes. In the CRA’s
view, any repayment of the principal portion of a borrowing would reduce
the portions of the line of credit, mortgage or loan that are used for
both eligible and ineligible purposes.</p>
<p>The individual cannot allocate the repayment specifically to the
ineligible portion of the borrowing. Instead, applying the original
eligible use percentage to the balance, interest on $32,000 of the
borrowed money (being 40% of $80,000) will be deductible.</p>
